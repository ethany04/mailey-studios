    question: "Can I get a refund for a retainer?",
    answer:
      "No, the retainer is not refundable. In respect to my business and time, if you decide to cancel with me, I unfortunately can not give you a refund as this was a session I could have booked with another client.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you retouch your images?",
    answer:
      "Yes, as part of the professionally edited photos, I will edit out anything you think is extra  or distracting within reason.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer shorter sessions?",
    answer:
      "My shortest session time is 45 minutes, this offers enough time for you to get warmed up to the camera and have a variety of poses in your photos. I will not offer discounts to shorten any of my sessions.",
  },
  {
    question: "What do I wear for my photos?",
    answer:
      "After you book your session with me, I will send you my outfit guide. I love to see you express yourself in your shoot, so beyond my suggestions, wear what makes you feel most yourself/most comfortable!",
  },
  {
    question: "I donâ€™t know how to pose. Will you pose me at the shoot?",
    answer:
      "Surprisingly this is a very common question. Of course I will pose you at the shoot! My job is to make you comfortable in front of the lens and provide poses that make my clients feel confident. I will always have ideas for poses that help fulfill your vision!",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I bring my friends and family to the shoot?",
    answer:
      "Please! I love when clients bring their loved ones to their shoot, it always makes the process so much more fun.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take for me to receive my photos?",
    answer:
      "My turnaround time is 2 weeks. If you need this to be expedited, there will be an additional cost on a case-to-case basis.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you do reschedules?",
    answer:
      "If the weather conditions are not suitable (such as rain, snow, or sleet), I will determine whether we need to reschedule. Please note that I cannot control sunlight, so cloudy skies alone will not be a valid reason to reschedule. I will notify you at least 24 hours in advance if the shoot needs to be postponed!",
